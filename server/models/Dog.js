// In this case, findByName will be attached to the model and objects.
// They will be able to call this function, but they won't be able to
// reference any instance variables of that object (or at least accurately)
// These are used when you want a public function you can call to do a task,
// not a method that uses or returns instance variables
// That is, these are used when you don't need an object, just a function to call.
